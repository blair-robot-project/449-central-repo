Thanks for helping contribute to FRC Team 449's code! Whether you're
on our team or another, we're glad to have your contributions.
However, we use a fairly strict framework, and contributions should 
adhere to it. First, no code should be written directly in Master.
Instead, you should make a branch, and then submit a pull request
when your code is finished and ready to go. How do you know if your
code is ready to be merged? For starters, it has to work. The code must
both compile and deploy with no errors, and should perform its intended
function correctly. The next check is to make sure the code meets our
code guidelines, found [here](http://team449.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Code_Standards),
and that the organization of your files matches our [file structure guidelines](http://team449.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Filetree_Structure).
If it does, the last thing you need to worry about is that it is good
OOP design. If your code breaks information hiding, it won't be
accepted unless the break is absolutely necessary. You can read about
good OOP design [here](http://team449.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Information_Hiding)
and [here](http://team449.shoutwiki.com/wiki/Interfaces).
